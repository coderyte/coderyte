<p>Your Last Stop Before Becoming a Confident Software Developer
Learning programming and web development by yourself is a challenging task. Have you spent months going through books, tutorials and online courses, but feel all you can do is follow instructions, and don’t have the clarity and confidence to build production quality applications yourself?

It’s time to stop messing around. Like other fields, the best way to learn software development is through a structured process, a lot of practice, and timely support when you are stuck. A well crafted learning program gives you a roadmap and structure, pushes you through potholes and helps navigate you away from time sinks. You still need to work hard, but you’ll actually stay excited and enjoy the process.

Our immersive program guides you through hundreds of lessons and assignments to build real life, production ready projects over four months, with full support from experienced instructors. We will build your programming and web development skills from the ground up, all the way to the professional level. It’s not for everyone - if you are learning programming as a hobby, our program can be too much. But if you are committed and ready to work hard, we promise a transformative learning experience that will turn you into a confident developer.</p>
